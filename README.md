# Important notes
### * The path sent "/zip" must be separated by "/"  Example : C:/user/desktop/zip/first/bladsa.ext
### * "/zip" Url deliberately makes you wait 7 seconds to see the "IN_PROGRESS" status
> If path is represents a file program create a zip file in same folder
 
> if path is represents a folder program create a zip file in 1 up level folder (for above example : C:/user/desktop/zip/)
